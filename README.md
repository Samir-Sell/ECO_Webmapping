# Eco_Webmapping

This is a webmap I created for a school project. The webmap uses a fragment of wild life value sites which were downloaded from the [Governement of Ontario GeoHub](https://geohub.lio.gov.on.ca/datasets/wildlife-values-site/geoservice). The sites are all represented as point data with the majority of sites being important nesting areas. I will document my thought processes, the tools I used, and this issues I ran into below.
